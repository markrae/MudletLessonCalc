MudletLessonCalc
================

This is a package for Mudlet that adds a command for calculating lesson costs for Iron Realms Entertainment games. The basic syntax is LESSONCALC &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage> TO &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage>. It also supports using LESSONCALC &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage> PLUS &lt;number of lessons>. The second usage will calculate how far you'd be in the skill if you added that number of lessons.

This package was originally made for Lusternia but should work fine with any other IRE game. Just note that the skillrank "skilled" is called "master" on Lusternia.
