MudletLessonCalc
================

This is a package for Mudlet that adds a command for calculating lesson costs for Iron Realms Entertainment games. The basic syntax is LESSONCALC &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage> TO &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage>. It also supports using LESSONCALC &lt;skillrank> &lt;percentage> PLUS &lt;number of lessons>. The second usage will calcualte how far you'd be in the skill if you added that number of lessons.
